# **Ed Goold**

I am a career switcher from law who is excited by this fresh coding challenge and all the opportunities that lie ahead.

I recently completed a 4 month coding bootcamp at Makers Academy in London where I learnt Ruby, Ruby-on-Rails, JavaScript, Python and Django.  I also had exposure to back-end tech in Node.js and PostgreSQL, among others.  Beyond individual tech, the course at Makers had a strong emphasis on TDD and BDD software development within a wider context of Agile and XP values, which has shaped and guided my individual learning and development as a coder.

I am now in a position to build on both my front-end and back-end experience and I am looking for a first coding role that will challenge and stretch me as both a developer and a professional.  

My background is as a qualified UK lawyer with extensive experience in high tech sectors.  I have spent several years in roles in private practice, in-house and government, principally focused on the practice areas of intellectual property, antitrust/competition and financial regulation (more detail below).  I have a proven track record of delivering challenging workstreams in high pressure environments and I will be able to bring that experience to bear in my next role.

At this early stage in my career I have developed a general interest in the field of legaltech (and have met with and spoken to a number of individuals in the area) while also developing some more specific interests in data compliance/blockchain opportunities.

Associate position with elite UK "Magic Circle" law firm specialising in competition and antitrust matters.

This work covered a wide range of practice areas from merger control, through behavioural investigations to commercial advice in a number of different sectors across multiple jurisdictions (UK, EU, US, China etc).

While at Allen & Overy I was also seconded to RBS where I first gained exposure to blockchain issues in advising RBS on its potential involvement in the development of a private blockchain consortium for the financial services sector.  This proved to be the early major driver in my coding interests and subsequent discussions with contacts with common interests has given rise to the potential data compliance tech/blockchain opportunities briefly set out above.

My role on the paroxetine investigation in particular gave me valuable early experience of project management and the delivery of challenging workstreams in a high pressure environment, also involving the supervision and management of more junior members' work.
