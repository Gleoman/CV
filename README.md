**Ed Goold**

I am a career switcher who is new to coding and I am excited by this fresh challenge and the myriad opportunities that lie ahead.

My background is as a qualified lawyer with extensive experience in high tech sectors.  I have spent several years in roles in private practice, in-house and government, principally focused on the practice areas of intellectual property, antitrust/competition and financial regulation (more detail below).

I am still educating myself about opportunities in the tech world but at this early stage I have developed a general interest in the field of legaltech (and have met with and spoken to a number of individuals in the area) while also developing some more specific interests in data compliance/blockchain opportunities.

In general I am looking for a role that will challenge and stretch me as both a developer and a professional.  I have a proven track record of delivering challenging workstreams in high pressure environments and I will be able to bring that experience to bear in my next role.

This work covered a wide range of practice areas from merger control, through behavioural investigations to commercial advice in a number of different sectors across multiple jurisdictions (UK, EU, US, China etc).

While at Allen & Overy I was also seconded to RBS where I first gained exposure to blockchain issues in advising RBS on its potential involvement in the development of a private blockchain consortium for the financial services sector.  This proved to be the early major driver in my coding interests and subsequent discussions with contacts with common interests has given rise to the potential data compliance tech/blockchain opportunities briefly set out above.
